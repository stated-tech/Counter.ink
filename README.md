This repository constitues a rather detailed first version, providing a solid understanding of the functioning of our platform.

- You will we have a preliminary draft of the smart contract. Additional features such as partial fill (which allows for accepting a part of a proposed transaction, for example, accepting 5 ETH when 10 ETH are offered) will be added in the subsequent updates. 
Furthermore, we will be incorporating comprehensive testing features and bolstering the overall security of the contract.

- Additionally, we have included a React component that we plan to utilize. This is merely to demonstrate the logic for communicating with the smart contract. 
The design proposal is available on Figma (check our proposal) ; our task will then be to simply connect all the components according to the logic of the button provided here.

This is a part of our ongoing commitment to ensure a seamless and secure user experience as we continue to refine and expand our platform's capabilities.
