# Counter.ink

This repository contains an initial version of our platform, which provides a comprehensive understanding of its functionality. 

## Smart Contracts

#### Current feature

The smart contract contained in this repository embodies essential features and functionalities.
Currently, it features two primary functions: one to create an order and another to accept the swap. This foundation allows for the basic transactional operations to take place.

#### Future development

In our continuous pursuit to enhance user experience and provide versatile trading options, we have future functionalities planned. A key feature that we aim to integrate is 'Partial Fill'. This function enables a user to have greater flexibility in accepting orders. For instance, if a user proposes an exchange of 10 ETH valued at 2000 euros each, another user has the choice to accept a partial order of, say, 5 ETH for 1000 euros, without the need for the proposer to create a new order.

Furthermore, our upcoming updates will focus on comprehensive testing features and strengthening the overall security of the contract.

## React Components

In addition to smart contracts, we have included a React component in this repository. The purpose of this component is to showcase the logic required for communication with the smart contract. The design proposal for the user interface can be found on Figma (refer to our proposal).

Our subsequent responsibility will be to integrate all components as per the logic of the button provided in our design proposal, thus creating a cohesive and functional user interface.


The ongoing development of our platform is centered on our commitment to ensuring a seamless and secure user experience, as we progressively refine and expand our platform's capabilities
